  The story of modern pop music cannot be told without giving credit to those who came before.
There is an odd misconception by the public that this idea is a purely nostalgic, as if everything
in pop culture exists in a vacuum. I strongly disagree with that philosophy.

  It is impossible to throw a conversational stone and not land squarely on the doorstep of The Beatles.
Since their iconic performance on the Ed Sullivan Show in 1964, the four boys from Liverpool have invaded the
public consciousness in a miraculously brief career. The Beatles spearheaded the British Invasion, turned
the pop landscape away from R&B, and became the first real superstars all before the Summer of Love.
It is almost hard to believe that they traded their mop-tops and suits for long lochs and British officer
uniforms in under a decade. My observations and tall tales have been echoed for decades by hundreds of
millions of people around the world. Simply put, praising The Beatles was as common as praising God.

So, why is this immense cultural presence being forgotten?

The truth is, it isn't. It is merely becoming the cultural itself.

  Once The Beatles disbanded after their run of beloved record-breaking albums and tours, their impact sent a shockwave through
the entertainment industry. Rumors and mythology circulated around the band's members and those close to them. All the while, young men
from one end of the Earth to the next picked up guitars and matching outfits to start their own take on British rock, experimental
songwriting, and psychedelia. Some of those artists had their rise and started their own domino effect of collateral influence in their
respective niches or genres. Suddenly, areas of pop culture that The Beatles couldn't quite reach were being curated. The legendary
"Beatlemania" had its second wind. Quieter, but bigger than any scrappy band of fellows could imagine.

Today, the spirit of the Fab Four lives on, their roots nearly untraceable in today's culture of excess.
No amount of nostalgia can cloud the fact that we are descendants of that which came before. We're echoes of a voice long gone.
Why not find the lips from which it came?
